Perfect. Let’s design a **modular, scalable, real-time system** that supports your core needs:

- High-throughput **behavior tracking**  
- Real-time **matchmaking logic**  
- Seamless **co-play interaction**  
- Fast **persona updates & verdict generation**  
- Viral **sharing and leaderboard systems**

# 🧠 VibePlay – System Design (MVP v1)

## 🏗️ Overview Architecture (High-Level Components)

```plaintext
Client (Mobile App)
    |
    | REST/GraphQL API
    ↓
Backend (Node.js / Express or FastAPI)
    ├── User Service
    ├── Activity Service
    ├── VibePersona Engine
    ├── Matching Engine
    ├── CoPlay Session Manager
    ├── Notification & Verdict Service
    ├── Leaderboard & Referral System
    └── Analytics Pipeline
        |
        ↓
  PostgreSQL + Redis + Firebase Auth
        |
        ↓
    ML/Scoring Engine (Python Service)
```

---

## 🔐 Authentication

- **Auth Provider**: Firebase Auth (phone/OTP login or anonymous login)
- **Session Management**: JWT or Firebase token  
- **Security**: Rate limiting (per IP), token verification middleware

---

## 🧍 1. User Service

Handles:
- Registration & Onboarding
- School association
- Streaks
- Settings & persona display

DB Tables:
- `users`, `schools`, `user_streaks`, `user_settings`

---

## 🎮 2. Activity Service

Handles:
- Fetching activities (puzzle, scroll, quiz)
- Logging user interaction
- Storing structured behavior data

Key Actions Captured:
- Emoji reaction
- Choice made
- Time on content
- Replay or skip

DB Tables:
- `activities`, `user_activity_logs`

Caching:
- Redis for serving trending games & content quickly

---

## 🧬 3. VibePersona Engine

Handles:
- Trait scoring logic (based on behavior logs)
- Mapping user to `persona_profile` (Explorer, Creator, Rebel, etc.)
- Updates after every 3–5 meaningful actions

Components:
- Rule-based scoring engine (MVP)
- Event-driven (user completed activity → trigger persona update)

DB Tables:
- `vibe_personas`, `trait_scores`

---

## 💕 4. Matchmaking Engine

Handles:
- Matching users based on VibePersona similarity
- Filters by:
  - Same school / region
  - Temporal overlap (active around same time)
  - Recent interaction scores
- Triggers co-play session request

Mechanism:
- Rule-based for MVP → ML graph-matching later

DB Tables:
- `user_matches`, `match_scores`, `match_requests`

---

## 🎭 5. CoPlay Session Manager

Handles:
- Two-user co-op session (sync logic, fallback to async)
- Shared activity logging
- Emoji-only reactions
- Ending session → trigger verdict

Tech:
- WebSocket or Socket.IO for real-time sync
- Fall back: polling if async

DB Tables:
- `co_play_sessions`, `session_actions`, `match_verdicts`

---

## ✅ 6. Verdict Generator

Handles:
- Go / No-Go / Try Again generation
- Factors:
  - Decision overlap %
  - Emoji similarity
  - Response timing
  - Total session sync score

Components:
- Scoring script (Python or Node)
- Feed into:
  - Match history
  - Persona updates

---

## 📣 7. Sharing & Viral Systems

Handles:
- Shareable match cards
- School leaderboards
- Referral link tracking

Tech:
- Pre-generated image templates (using Puppeteer or dynamic HTML to image)
- Firebase Dynamic Links for referrals

DB Tables:
- `referrals`, `leaderboards`, `match_shares`

---

## 📊 8. Analytics & Event Tracking

Tools:
- Mixpanel / Segment
- Firebase Analytics (optional)
- Custom events from:
  - Activity usage
  - Time in app
  - Match flow drops

Critical Events:
- Session start/end
- Match accepted
- Co-play completed
- Verdict generated
- Match card shared

---

## 🔄 Caching / Performance Layer

Use **Redis** for:
- Recently matched users
- Leaderboards
- Activity of the day
- Match queue

Use **Background Workers** (e.g. BullMQ or Celery):
- Process persona updates
- Send “match available” notifications
- Generate leaderboard rankings hourly

## 🧪 Tech Stack Summary

| Layer | Tool |
|-------|------|
| Frontend | React Native |
| Backend | Node.js (Express) or FastAPI (Python) |
| Auth | Firebase Auth |
| DB | PostgreSQL |
| Cache | Redis |
| Analytics | Mixpanel + custom logging |
| Real-time | Socket.IO or WebSockets |

## 🧱 Data Tables Summary

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `users` | Core user data |
| `schools` | Campus-level grouping |
| `activities` | All games, quizzes, scroll items |
| `user_activity_logs` | All user behavior events |
| `vibe_personas` | User's calculated traits |
| `user_matches` | Potential and active matches |
| `co_play_sessions` | Paired shared game sessions |
| `match_verdicts` | Binary results from co-play |
| `leaderboards` | Grouped by school, daily/weekly |
| `referrals` | Tracks growth loops |

---

## ⚙️ System Flow (End-to-End)

```plaintext
1. User signs up → onboarded to school → plays activity
2. Behavior logs saved → event triggers VibePersona update
3. Persona similarity detected → match triggered
4. Co-play session begins → choices & emoji logged
5. After session → scoring engine → Verdict: Go / No-Go
6. User gets card → shares → leaderboard updated
7. Friends join via link → feedback loop continues
```
