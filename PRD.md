# 🧠 Product Requirements Document (PRD) – Updated for Viral TG Focus

## 📛 Product Name (Placeholder)
**VibePlay** – *“No bios. No chat. Just vibes.”*

---

## 🎯 Product Vision

To create the most authentic and playful matchmaking app — built not on swipes or text, but on **how people behave**. Users connect by solving puzzles, reacting to content, or completing challenges — all without messaging.

VibePlay turns everyday interaction into **emotional signal**, and tells users when someone is *really worth their time*. It's the **GAS-style emotional game layer** for connection — for friends, crushes, and everything in between.

---

## 💡 Problem Statement

Young people want to **connect**, but are tired of:
- Boring swiping
- Creepy DMs
- Social pressure around chatting

They’re looking for **low-stakes, fun-first, drama-free** ways to know who “gets” them — without putting themselves out there too much.

---

## 🎯 Target Audience (TG)

### 🎯 Primary:  
**High School Seniors + College Freshers (Ages 16–21)**  
Why?  
- Emotionally charged, identity-exploring phase  
- Huge influence from peers → FOMO = growth  
- Not allowed on traditional dating apps  
- Prefer games, reactions, and safe spaces > awkward chat

| Trait | Relevance |
|-------|-----------|
| ✨ Identity Seeking | Want to know themselves + who they match with |
