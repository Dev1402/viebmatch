## 🔗 Relationships Summary (Simplified)

```plaintext
User ───────< UserActivityLog >────── Activity
  │                                      │
  │                                      V
  ├── VibePersona                   CoPlaySession
  │                                      │
  │                                 MatchVerdict
  │                                      ▲
  └───< UserMatch >───────────────<──────┘

User ── belongs to ──> School
School ── has many ──> Leaderboards
```

## 📦 Storage Notes

- **UserActivityLog** = high-volume table. Consider event-based or cold storage with fast summary caching.
- **VibePersona** = regenerated periodically or on major activity.
- **MatchVerdict** = used for analytics + social sharing.
- **CoPlaySession** = the core relational anchor between two users.

---

## ✅ What's Next?

I can now:
- Turn this into a **visual UML diagram (PNG or draw.io)**
- Create **SQL schema** from this UML
- Define **API contracts** (REST/GraphQL) between these entities
- Map data pipelines for **trait scoring + ML persona engine**

What do you want next, Cofounder?
